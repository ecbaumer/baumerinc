Get started with Analytics
To start collecting basic data from a website or mobile app:

1. Create or sign in to your Analytics account:

- Go to google.com/analytics

- Click SIGN IN > Analytics.

- Do one of the following:
 - To create an account, click More options > Create account.
 - To sign in to your account, enter the email address and password associated with the account.

2. Set up a property in your Analytics account. A property represents your website or app, and is the collection point in Analytics for the data from your site or app.

3. Set up a reporting view in your property. Views let you create filtered perspectives of your data; for example, all data except from your companyâ€™s internal IP addresses, or all data associated with a specific sales region.

4. Follow the instructions to add the tracking code to your website or mobile app so you can collect data in you Analytics property.
